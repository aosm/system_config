	</names>
	<description>
		<p>The Mac OS X booter (<path>boot.efi</path> on EFI-based Macintosh systems) is responsible for
			loading the initial parts of the operating system into memory and executing them. Its default
			behavior is to start up Mac OS X in graphical mode. However, certain behavior can be
			configured using the <path>com.apple.Boot.plist</path> file, as well as NVRAM variables,
			EFI boot options, and keyboard "snag keys".
		</p>
		<p>The <path>com.apple.Boot.plist</path> is a standard <manpage>plist<section>5</section></manpage>
			format Core Foundation property list stored in XML format. Keys are generally strings like <command>Kernel Flags</command>,
			with either string or integer values. The following key-values are currently supported:
		</p>
		<dl>
			<dt><command>Kernel Flags</command></dt><dd>[string] This option specifies arguments to be passed
				directly to the kernel to change its behavior (although some kernel options are parsed by the
				booter as well for correctness). Common options include "debug=0x144" to enable kernel debugging,
				"-v" to enable verbose boot, "-s" to boot to single user mode, "cpus=1" to simulate a
				single core system, and "maxmem=1024" to cap available memory to 1024 MB RAM. All desired options
				should be space-separated within the &lt;string&gt; tag. The default value is the empty string.</dd>
			
			<dt><command>MKext Cache</command></dt><dd>[string] This option specifies the mkext file
				to be loaded, which contains kernel extensions. The path uses backslash ("\") path delimeters.
				The default value is <path>System\Library\Caches\com.apple.kext.caches\Startup\Extensions.mkext</path>.</dd>
			
			<dt><command>Kernel</command></dt><dd>[string] This option specifies the kernel file to
				be loaded. The path uses backslash ("\") path delimeters. The default
				value is <path>mach_kernel</path>.</dd>
			
			<dt><command>Kernel Cache</command></dt><dd>[string] This option specifies the prelinked
				kernel file to be loaded, which contains both the kernel and kernel extensions, linked
				at their final load addresses. The path uses backslash ("\") path delimeters. The
				default value is calculated programmatically using
				<path>System\Library\Caches\com.apple.kext.caches\Startup\kernelcache_${ARCH}.${CHECKSUM}</path>
				as the template, where ${ARCH} is the architecture of the kernel ("i386" or "x86_64") and
				${CHECKSUM} is a 32-bit hash of characteristics of the boot volume and machine hardware.</dd>
			
			<dt><command>Kernel Architecture</command></dt><dd>[string] This option specifies which kernel
				architecture to use when the kernel file is a universal binary and the hardware supports
				more than one kernel architecture. It can be either "i386" or "x86_64" to choose the respective
				slice of the universal binary. If the kernel is not a universal binary, this option has
				no effect. If the hardware only supports the 32-bit kernel, this option has no effect. The default
				value is determined programmatically based on the hardware, and whether Mac OS X Server
				is being used.</dd>
			
			<dt><command>Root UUID</command></dt><dd>[string] This option is rarely used and specifies
				to the kernel what block device should be probed as the root filesystem ("/"), and is most
				commonly overriden by the OS installation software when installing onto AppleRAID volumes. It can be
				either a filesystem volume UUID, as represented by <command>diskutil info</command>, or
				a GPT partition UUID. The default is generated programmatically based on which filesystem
				the booter itself was loaded from.</dd>
		</dl>
		
		<p>Since the <path>com.apple.Boot.plist</path> file exists on the root filesystem, it is tied to that 
			OS volume, and is no longer honored if Startup Disk or <manpage>bless<section>8</section></manpage>
			is used to change the boot preference to another volume.
		</p>
		
		<p>The <command>Kernel Flags</command> options can also be specified via <arg>--option</arg>
			to <manpage>bless<section>8</section></manpage>, which encodes
			the string in the EFI boot options along with the
			OS boot volume preference. The space-separated strings
			are merged with kernel flags specified in the
			<path>com.apple.Boot.plist</path> and NVRAM.
		</p>
		
		<p>At boot time, the booter checks to see if certain keys are being pressed, and alters behavior accordingly.
			This is in addition to similar functionality that the firmware itself may implement before starting the
			booter. Since pressing keys requires physical interaction, they take precendence over preferences
			set through other means, including the <path>com.apple.Boot.plist</path> file and NVRAM.
			The following key combinations are currently supported:
		</p>
		<dl>
			<dt><command>Shift</command></dt><dd>Boot in Safe Mode. Effectively the same as passing "-x" in
				<command>Kernel Flags</command>, and causes most caches to be ignored by the booter.</dd>
			
			<dt><command>Command-S</command></dt><dd>Boot in Single User Mode. Effectively the same as passing "-s" in
				<command>Kernel Flags</command>, and causes the system to boot to an interactive shell
				with no system services started.</dd>
			
			<dt><command>Command-V</command></dt><dd>Boot in Verbose Mode. Effectively the same as passing "-v" in
				<command>Kernel Flags</command>, and causes the system to boot to verbose text logging before
				starting the graphical user interface.</dd>

                        <dt><command>Command-R</command></dt><dd>Boot in Recovery Mode.  This causes the system to boot into special Recovery System image, which can be used used to restore the system from Time Machine Backup, re-install Mac OS X, or use Disk Utility to repair or erase disks.</dd>
			
			<dt><command>3 2</command></dt><dd>Boot with the 32-bit kernel. Effectively the same as passing
				"arch=i386" in <command>Kernel Flags</command>, and causes the system to prefer the 32-bit
				kernel on systems that would otherwise boot the 64-bit kernel.</dd>
			
			<dt><command>6 4</command></dt><dd>Boot with the 64-bit kernel (if supported on this system). Effectively the same as passing
				"arch=x86_64" in <command>Kernel Flags</command>, and causes the system to prefer the 64-bit
				kernel on systems that would otherwise boot the 32-bit kernel. If the 64-bit kernel is not supported, the option is ignored.</dd>
		</dl>

	<environment>
		<p>The Mac OS X booter can also be controlled by NVRAM variables, which are analogous
			to environment variables. NVRAM variables are key-value pairs. The "boot-args" NVRAM variable
			can be used to provide additional arguments to the kernel, and will be merged with
			<command>Kernel Flags</command> in the <path>com.apple.Boot.plist</path> file and
			EFI boot options set with <manpage>bless<section>8</section></manpage>.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			Since NVRAM variables are system-wide, they are consulted regardless of what OS volume is
			set as the boot preference. NVRAM variables are persistent even when the boot preference
			is changed by Startup Disk or <manpage>bless<section>8</section></manpage>.
